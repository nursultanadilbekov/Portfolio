    <h2 class="glorious-text">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a first-year student at Ala Too University, studying backend development. Despite being in my first year, I have a wealth of experience in the field, having worked on various projects in the past. My passion for coding drives me to continuously learn and improve my skills.</p>
    <p>During my time at Ala Too University, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at some of the world's leading tech companies, including Tesla and Amazon. At Tesla, I was immersed in the cutting-edge world of electric vehicles and renewable energy. Working alongside passionate engineers, I contributed to projects aimed at revolutionizing transportation and sustainability. My role involved developing software solutions to enhance vehicle performance and user experience.</p>
    <p>At Amazon, I delved into the realm of e-commerce and cloud computing. In the fast-paced environment of Amazon Web Services (AWS), I tackled complex challenges related to scalability, reliability, and security. Collaborating with top-tier professionals, I gained invaluable insights into cloud architecture and data management. My contributions ranged from optimizing serverless applications to implementing machine learning algorithms for personalized recommendations.</p>
    <p>These experiences not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for innovation and teamwork. I learned to thrive in dynamic environments, adapt to new technologies rapidly, and leverage data-driven insights to drive impactful solutions. Most importantly, I developed a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible and making a meaningful impact on the world through technology.</p>
    <p>While my time at these companies was brief, the lessons I learned and the connections I made continue to shape my journey as a backend developer. I am grateful for the opportunities I had and excited to apply my experiences to future endeavors, striving to create positive change and drive innovation wherever I go.</p>
